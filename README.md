Mood Journal — SvelteKit prototype

This repository contains a starter SvelteKit app scaffold for a Mood-Driven Interactive Journal using Svelte, SvelteKit, Tailwind, Drizzle (SQLite), and Lucia for auth. It's a prototype with placeholders and initial structure.

Run locally:

1. Install dependencies: npm install
2. Start dev server: npm run dev

Notes:

- This scaffold includes server modules for Drizzle and Lucia wiring as examples. You still need to configure environment variables and run migrations.
